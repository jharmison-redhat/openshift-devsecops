# This is needed to access the authenticated Red Hat registry (e.g. to pull

#     https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
#   login with your Red Hat credentials, then go to Service Accounts (upper
#   right corner) and create a new service account. Click on the name of the
#   service account, go to the 'OpenShift Secret' tab, click 'view its
#   contents,' and then copy value after `.dockerconfigjson` into this var.
# It is recommended to generate a new service account before a workshop and
#   delete it after, as this token is available in each of the users' projects
#   (and can be used in the future if the service account isn't deleted)
